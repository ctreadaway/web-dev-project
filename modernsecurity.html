      <h2>Modern Web Security (2000s â€“ Present)</h2>
      <p>Modern web security encompasses a comprehensive set of tools, protocols, and best practices designed to protect users and data in today's complex digital landscape. As web applications have evolved, so have the methods to secure them against a myriad of threats.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
      <h3>Key Modern Security Tools</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HTTPS with TLS:</strong> Encrypts data in transit, ensuring confidentiality and integrity between clients and servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Security Policy (CSP):</strong> Mitigates XSS attacks by specifying allowed sources for content loading.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Cookies:</strong> Attributes like <code>Secure</code>, <code>HttpOnly</code>, and <code>SameSite</code> enhance cookie security, reducing risks of theft and cross-site attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect:</strong> Provide secure authorization and authentication mechanisms for third-party applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Adds layers of security by requiring multiple verification methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):</strong> Filter and monitor HTTP traffic to protect against common attacks like SQL injection and XSS.</li>
        <li><strong>Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):</strong> Integrates security into applications, allowing them to detect and prevent real-time threats.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Modern Threats & Defenses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phishing Attacks:</strong> Combated through user education, email filtering, and MFA implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong> Prevented using CSP, input validation, and output encoding techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):</strong> Mitigated with CSRF tokens and proper use of <code>SameSite</code> cookie attributes.</li>
        <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Addressed by rate limiting, traffic filtering, and scalable infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Supply Chain Attacks:</strong> Reduced by verifying third-party dependencies and employing software composition analysis tools.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Security Best Practices</h3>
      <p>Integrating security throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is crucial. Key practices include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Threat Modeling:</strong> Identifying potential threats and designing mitigations during the planning phase.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Coding Standards:</strong> Adhering to guidelines that prevent common vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Code Reviews:</strong> Ensuring code quality and identifying security issues early.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Testing:</strong> Utilizing static and dynamic analysis tools to detect vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Keeping an eye on applications and infrastructure for suspicious activities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Industry Compliance & Standards</h3>
      <p>Organizations must adhere to various regulations to ensure data protection and privacy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</strong> Governs data protection and privacy in the European Union.</li>
        <li><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</strong> Enhances privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS):</strong> Sets requirements for organizations handling credit card information.</li>
        <li><strong>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):</strong> Regulates the handling of healthcare information in the U.S.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Compliance with these standards not only avoids legal penalties but also fosters trust with users and stakeholders.</p>
