            <h2>Early Web Security (1990s – Early 2000s)</h2>
            <p>In the early days of the web, security was often an afterthought. Websites were mostly static, and user interaction was minimal. However, as interactivity increased through login forms, comments, and e-commerce, so did vulnerabilities. Let's explore the common threats, challenges, and how early web security began to take shape.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content">
            <h3>Common Early Vulnerabilities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unencrypted HTTP:</strong> All data was transmitted in plaintext, leaving passwords, personal information, and financial data exposed to eavesdroppers.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong> Attackers could inject scripts into input fields, allowing them to hijack sessions or perform phishing attacks on unsuspecting users.</li>
                <li><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> Without input sanitization, SQL queries could be manipulated by attackers to view, modify, or delete database contents.</li>
                <li><strong>Weak Authentication:</strong> Passwords were often stored without hashing or encryption. Brute force attacks and password reuse made accounts vulnerable.</li>
                <li><strong>Buffer Overflows:</strong> Programs written in C/C++ were especially prone to memory-based exploits that allowed remote code execution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>First Line of Defense</h3>
            <p>Initially, security was handled at the network level rather than the application level. Tools included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Packet Filtering Firewalls:</strong> Allowed or blocked traffic based on IP, port, and protocol.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control Lists (ACLs):</strong> Used to restrict access to sensitive systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Antivirus Software:</strong> Focused on known threats, primarily on the client side.</li>
                <li><strong>Manual Code Review:</strong> Security auditing was a slow and manual process without automated tools.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) began emerging as a vital solution, encrypting data in transit to prevent sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>

            <h3>Milestone Moments</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1994–1995:</strong> Netscape develops and introduces SSL 2.0 (followed by SSL 3.0 in 1996), providing the foundation for secure web communication.</li>
                <li><strong>1996:</strong> First recorded major XSS attacks begin appearing in public forums and early blogging platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>1998:</strong> First known SQL injection incident reported, leading to increased awareness of input sanitization.</li>
                <li><strong>1999:</strong> The OWASP project is launched to educate developers and promote secure coding practices.</li>
                <li><strong>2001:</strong> The Code Red worm exploits buffer overflow in Microsoft IIS, spreading rapidly and infecting hundreds of thousands of servers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Legacy of Early Web Security</h3>
            <p>Despite the limitations, this era laid the groundwork for today's security practices. It led to the creation of browser-based sandboxing, security headers like Content-Security-Policy, and awareness that application-layer security is essential. Many of the original vulnerabilities still exist today, but the tools to detect and defend against them have drastically improved.</p>
