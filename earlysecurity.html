            <h2>Early Web Security (1990s – Early 2000s)</h2>
            <p>In the early days of the web, security was often an afterthought. Websites were mostly static, and user interaction was minimal. However, as interactivity increased, so did vulnerabilities. Let’s explore the major threats and the beginnings of web security.</p>

            <h3>Common Early Vulnerabilities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unencrypted HTTP:</strong> Data was transferred in plain text, making it easy to intercept.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong> Malicious scripts were injected into webpages, allowing attackers to steal cookies or credentials.</li>
                <li><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> Poor validation allowed attackers to manipulate backend databases through form fields.</li>
                <li><strong>Weak Authentication:</strong> Sites often used simple username/password systems with no encryption or hashing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>First Line of Defense</h3>
            <p>Security strategies included simple firewalls, IP restrictions, and basic antivirus software. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) began gaining traction in the late 90s, offering encrypted connections.</p>

            <h3>Milestone Moments</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1995: Netscape introduces SSL v2 for encrypted communication.</li>
                <li>1999: OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is founded to provide security best practices.</li>
                <li>2001: Microsoft issues major updates to address IIS vulnerabilities exploited by the Code Red worm.</li>
            </ul>
